## Listener Library

This library aims to speed up setting up listeners by removing the need to write boiler plate code all the time. This is a somewhat opiniated library with some assumptions made for how things should be structured. It does not however, stop you from writing your own handlers to process the request, that part is entirely up to you, the developer.

Currently, only the `REST` is implemented. `TCP`, `UDP` and `MQTT` support will be added when the time and need permits.

## Documentation

Guides on how to use the library is explained the `docs` folder, which contains documentation for each of the listener
